2024-09-07 18:53:15,165 - rag-logger - INFO - output:Based on the provided context, there is no specific mention of a credit card that would be best for students. The context mainly covers the features and benefits of various ICICI credit cards, but it does not provide a comparison between them for different categories of users, such as students.

In general, a credit card for students should have low fees, a reasonable credit limit, and rewards or cashback programs that cater to students' needs. Some banks offer student credit cards with features such as lower interest rates, no annual fees, and rewards for good grades.

So, I would recommend checking with ICICI bank directly or visiting their website to see if they have any credit cards specifically designed for students.
